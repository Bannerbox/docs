Sign into Bannerbox and retrieve your API key from the [settings menu](https://bannerbox.io/settings). API keys are unique for your organization and can be manually regenerated once every 24 hours.

Install a script tag to the **header** of your site. Replace **YOUR_API_KEY** with the API key from the settings menu.

{% callout %}
<script src="https://bannerbox.io/client/bannerbox.js?apikey=YOUR_API_KEY" id="bannerbox-client"></script>
{% /callout %}

Make sure to use the above code snippet as is and replace **YOUR_API_KEY** only.
